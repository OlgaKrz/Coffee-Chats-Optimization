    "I kind of lied... the code is not optimizing the assignment because we are not really minimizing or maximizing for anything; we are just aiming for an assignment that respects a few constraints. So, in the search of that feasible solution, our objective function is just a constant value (decorative for the model to run properly and to assign values to the decision variable). The rationale behind the constraints listed below is maximizing the impact of the coffee chats, i.e.: motivate people to socialize with colleagues that they wouldn't otherwise (e.g.: seniors with juniors, employees in different cities, etc.).\n",
